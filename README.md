# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyses student performance data to identify factors influencing academic outcomes. The analysis focuses on study hours, attendance, and subject scores using Python and data visualisation techniques.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature engineering (average score)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualisation
- Insight generation

## Key Findings
- Increased study hours are associated with higher academic performance.
- Attendance is a strong predictor of student outcomes.
- Clear patterns can support data-driven educational interventions.

## Next Steps
- Expand dataset
- Add predictive modelling
- Apply analysis to real-world education or training datasets
